# PBFT

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) is a consensus algorithm designed to facilitate agreement among distributed or decentralized systems even in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. It aims to achieve consensus on the state of the system despite the potential for Byzantine failures, where nodes might exhibit arbitrary behavior, including sending incorrect or conflicting information.

## Key Components of pBFT:

### Roles in pBFT:

* Client: Initiates a request to the network.
* Replicas/Nodes: Participating nodes in the network that execute the consensus algorithm.
* Primary/Leader Node: Responsible for proposing requests and coordinating the consensus process.

## Steps in the pBFT Process:

### a. Request and Pre-Prepare:
* Client Request: A client sends a request to the primary node.
* Pre-Prepare: The primary node creates a pre-prepare message containing the proposed request and broadcasts it to other nodes.

### b. Prepare and Commit:
* Prepare: Upon receiving the pre-prepare message, nodes validate the request, then broadcast a prepare message to all nodes to signify their readiness to commit.
* Commit: Once a node collects prepare messages from a two-thirds majority of nodes, it broadcasts a commit message to all nodes, finalizing the agreement.

### c. Response and Execution:
* Response: The primary node collects commit messages from a two-thirds majority of nodes and sends a response to the client, confirming consensus on the request.
* Execution: Nodes execute the request and update their state based on the agreed-upon request.


## Key Characteristics and Advantages of pBFT:

* Resilience to Faults: pBFT tolerates Byzantine faults and ensures system operation as long as more than two-thirds of the nodes are honest and can communicate.

* Finality and Safety: Once a request is committed, it's considered final and safe within the network.

* Low Latency: pBFT typically achieves lower latency compared to some other consensus algorithms due to its optimized communication pattern and fewer rounds of message exchange.

* Efficiency and Throughput: It can handle a high throughput of transactions in a permissioned setting, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.

* Security: Offers a high level of security against malicious attacks or incorrect behaviors of nodes.

## Limitations and Considerations:
* Assumption of Node Behavior: pBFT assumes that nodes follow the protocol and don't deviate from the expected behavior.

* Message Complexity: The number of messages exchanged in the consensus process can increase with the number of nodes, potentially affecting scalability.

*  Synchronous Model: The original pBFT algorithm operates in a synchronous network model, which might not be suitable for all network environments.

* Dynamic Membership: Handling changes in the node membership during runtime might require adaptations or extensions to the basic pBFT algorithm.

## End

pBFT is commonly used in permissioned blockchain networks, distributed databases, and systems requiring high fault tolerance and Byzantine fault resistance while maintaining good throughput and finality of transactions.
